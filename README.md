Prevent charter from aging if you manually set them to be a teenager, child or infant. makes the game a wee buggy to say the least.

PS being an infant makes horseback spear fighting super easy at the cost of talking to people with half the horse's head in the way.

Just mods defaultagemodel so it should be compatible with other things. But this means it could affect pretty much anything that ages in the game, but I am unsure if so, let me know what all is affected so I can added

Also it seems about 50% of the time, the game will crash when you press "V" on v1.0.5 of the game, havent tested too much beyond or below that. and for the love of god backup your save files. this could corrupt them. also pretty much always crashes when you press "V" using an autosave, use the commandline if you need to. also don't change between versions for the same save file. it gets buggy.

THINGS AFFECTED

    The character you play
    interactions with other characters while playing as somethings could bug out
    Maybe Children????? needs confirmation
